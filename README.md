# HandTracking
This application was a final project for a Computer Vision class. The goal was to hack together a program that implemented OpenCV to track hand movement to trigger MIDI notes. The program implements an external library rtMidi to handle the MIDI side of things. This program uses simple hueristics, trial and error, and background removal to get the functionality of tracking the hand to work (it would have been better to use a trained nerual network, but lack of time, resources, and knowledge were limitating factors) Overall, the application is janky, slow, and kinda cheats in some ways to get the job done. Never the less, the goal was to make a proof of conecpt and report on the outcome, which was achieved. Included code may not be the prettiest, but it got the job done.
